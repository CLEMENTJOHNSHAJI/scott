Scott Test Reporter - Example project
=====================================

This project contains the necessary setup configuration to use Scott (see [pom.xml](https://github.com/dodie/scott/blob/master/scott-example/pom.xml))
and a bunch of failing tests to demonstrate the detailed failure messages.

Usage
-----
1. Be sure to ```mvn install``` Scott before trying this (in *../scott*).
2. Run ``` mvn install ``` to see the tests failing.
